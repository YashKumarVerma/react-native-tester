      React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a
      best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

      React primitives render to native platform UI, meaning your app uses the
      same native platform APIs other apps do.

      React components wrap existing native code and interact with native APIs
      via Reactâ€™s declarative UI paradigm and JavaScript. This enables native
      app development for whole new teams of developers, and can let existing
      native teams work much faster.

      Infinite Red, Microsoft, and Software Mansion.
